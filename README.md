# What is hipster?

*hipster* is a very simple mind-mapping application that I wrote a few years ago. I haven't updated this code in a while and it is nowhere near as advanced as other mind-mapping applications. I wrote it for my own use, and as I love using the keyboard, I made sure it works particularly well from the keyboard.

## Basic use

Create a new mind-map by choosing `File/New` from the menu. You will see a black-oval in the center of the screen. This is the heart of your mind-map. The central oval will have the keyboard focus so you should be able to replace the basic text by just typing.

- If you hit `RETURN`, the text will be set.

- To edit it again, press `Shift-RETURN`.

- To add a child branch hit the `TAB` key.

- To add a sibling branch (on the same level) hit the `RETURN` key.

- To undo an operation, hit `CTRL-U` (`CMD-U` on a Mac)
- To stop the mind-map moving, pressing the `SPACE` key

You can create cross-links between branches by holding down the shift key and dragging a line from one branch to another.

You can write additional notes against any branch by pressing `CTRL-I` (or `CMD-I` on a Mac) and enter further details.

You can paste the contents of your clipboard as a child-branch.

- If a branch if a URL, double-clicking it will open the URL in a browser.

- On the Mac, the paste-functionality is more extensive. For example, if you copy a file in the Finder, then paste it as a child-branch, double-clicking on the branch will open the file.

As well as this there are many other features which you can find through exploring the menus.
